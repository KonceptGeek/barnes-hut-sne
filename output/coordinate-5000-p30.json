Carloman of Bavaria, forced by an epidemic which broke out in his army, returns to Germany. When Louis the Stammerer receives news of the death of his father, Charles the Bald, he makes plans to go into West Francia to receive the oath of fidelity from his new subjects. On his way he learns that the magnates are refusing him obedience by rallying around Boso and the Abbot Hugh.
